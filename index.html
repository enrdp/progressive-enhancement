    <p>Some of Alan Watts’s most influential lessons and ideas emerged from lectures he gave 
        at universities across the United States, including his story of the Chinese farmer.</p>
    
        <p>The story, recorded and transcribed below (after the jump), 
            is also part of a collection of lectures entitled

<blockquote name="Alan Wilson Watts"
nationality="England"
job="philosopher"
religion="Buddhism">
<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his 
    neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q id="v1">We are so sorry 
        to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
        The farmer said, “<em>Maybe</em>.” 
        The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening 
        everybody came back and said, <q id="v2">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of 
            events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, “<em>Maybe</em>.”</p>

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was 
    thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q id="v3">Oh dear, that’s too 
        <em class="bad">bad</em>,</q> and the farmer responded, “<em>Maybe</em>.” 
        The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, 
        and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came
         around and said, <q id="v4">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, “<em>Maybe</em>.”</p>

<p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s 
    really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em class="good">good</em> 
    or <em class="bad">bad</em> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the 
    misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em class="good">good</em> 
    fortune.</p>

        Bananas are <em class="good">good</em> for monkeys,
